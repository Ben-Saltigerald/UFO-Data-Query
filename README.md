# [Project 1: UFO Sightings â€” Data Query: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ben-Saltigerald/PythonEmailExtractor)
Queried data from a csv file that includes records of UFO sightings across the world. I decided to filter the data to obtain information about sightings in every city that I have ever lived in. See cells in jupitor notebook for steps and details. 

- Imported the file and read it into a dictionary
- Filtered the data to look for sightings that inlcuded bright objects.
- Filtered the data by every city I have lived in obtained the average duration that each of these sightings lasted in each city.
